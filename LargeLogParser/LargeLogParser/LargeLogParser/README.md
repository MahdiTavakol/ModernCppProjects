# 🧾 Log File Parser Benchmark Project

This project generates synthetic log files with various proportions of `[INFO]`, `[WARN]`, and `[ERROR]` messages, and benchmarks different strategies for parsing them:

- `LogParser`: A **serial** log parser.
- `LogParserParallel`: A **parallel thread-based** parser.
- `LogParserParallelFuture`: A **`std::future`-based parallel** parser.
- `LogParserParallelRunner`: A manager for parallel parsing using multiple threads.

## 🛠 Features

- Synthetic log file generation with configurable message proportions and sizes.
- Parsing strategies supporting single-threaded and multi-threaded approaches.
- Performance benchmarks for different file sizes and thread configurations.
- Thread-safe I/O and progress reporting for parallel parsing.

## 🧪 Test Framework

Unit tests and performance benchmarks are implemented using **[Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)**.

### ✔️ How to Build & Run Tests

1. **Catch2 Integration**:  
   The project uses a single-header version of Catch2 (`catch_amalgamated.hpp`). No separate installation is required.

2. **Build with CMake or Visual Studio** (Make sure you have C++20 enabled):
   - If using Visual Studio:
     - Add `test.cpp` to your test target or create a new test project and include all `.h` and `.cpp` files.
     - Make sure to define `CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN` in one `.cpp` file to enable the main test runner.
   - If using CMake:
     ```cmake
     add_executable(runTests test.cpp)
     target_compile_features(runTests PRIVATE cxx_std_20)
     ```

3. **Run Tests**:
   Run the compiled test binary in terminal or from within Visual Studio. All tests will run and show timing/validation output.

## 🧪 Test Coverage

The test suite benchmarks and verifies:
- Parser correctness (e.g., count of `[INFO]`, `[WARN]`, `[ERROR]` lines).
- Scalability with increasing file sizes.
- Performance scaling with varying thread counts.
- Comparison between serial and different parallel implementations.

Benchmark results are printed to the console in a structured format.
